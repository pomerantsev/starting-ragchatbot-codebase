# Code Quality Tools Implementation

## Overview
Added essential code quality tools to the development workflow to ensure consistent code formatting and maintain high code standards throughout the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added to `pyproject.toml`
- **black>=24.0.0** - Automatic code formatting
- **flake8>=7.0.0** - Linting and style checking
- **isort>=5.13.0** - Import sorting
- **mypy>=1.8.0** - Static type checking

### 2. Configuration Files Created

#### `pyproject.toml` - Tool Configuration
- **Black configuration**: 88 character line length, Python 3.13 target, excludes build directories
- **isort configuration**: Black-compatible profile with consistent formatting
- **mypy configuration**: Type checking settings with reasonable strictness

#### `.flake8` - Flake8 Configuration
- 88 character line length (compatible with black)
- Ignores black-conflicting rules (E203, W503, E501)
- Excludes build directories and virtual environments

### 3. Development Scripts Created in `scripts/` Directory

#### `scripts/format.sh`
- Runs black for code formatting
- Runs isort for import sorting
- Executable script for quick formatting

#### `scripts/lint.sh`
- Runs flake8 for linting
- Runs mypy for type checking
- Provides comprehensive code quality checks

#### `scripts/quality.sh`
- Master script that runs all quality checks
- Includes formatting, linting, and testing
- One-command solution for complete code quality verification

### 4. Code Formatting Applied
- Applied black formatting to all 14 Python files in the codebase
- Organized imports with isort across all Python modules
- Ensured consistent code style throughout the project

### 5. Documentation Updated
- Added "Code Quality Commands" section to `CLAUDE.md`
- Documented all new scripts and individual tool commands
- Provided clear instructions for running quality checks

## Usage

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Format all code
./scripts/format.sh

# Run all linting checks
./scripts/lint.sh

# Run complete quality check suite
./scripts/quality.sh
```

### Individual Tools
```bash
uv run black .           # Format with black
uv run isort .           # Sort imports
uv run flake8           # Lint with flake8
uv run mypy .           # Type check with mypy
```

## Benefits
1. **Consistent Formatting** - Automatic code formatting ensures uniform style
2. **Error Prevention** - Linting catches potential issues before runtime
3. **Type Safety** - MyPy provides static type checking for Python
4. **Developer Productivity** - Scripts automate quality checks
5. **Code Quality** - Maintains high standards across the entire codebase

## Integration
These tools are now integrated into the development workflow and should be run before committing code changes to ensure consistency and quality.
