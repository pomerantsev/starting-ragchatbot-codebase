# Development Infrastructure Changes

This document tracks the major infrastructure improvements made to the RAG chatbot codebase.

## Code Quality Tools Implementation

### Overview
Added essential code quality tools to the development workflow to ensure consistent code formatting and maintain high code standards throughout the codebase.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Dependencies Added to `pyproject.toml`
- **black>=24.0.0** - Automatic code formatting
- **flake8>=7.0.0** - Linting and style checking
- **isort>=5.13.0** - Import sorting
- **mypy>=1.8.0** - Static type checking

#### 2. Configuration Files Created

##### `pyproject.toml` - Tool Configuration
- **Black configuration**: 88 character line length, Python 3.13 target, excludes build directories
- **isort configuration**: Black-compatible profile with consistent formatting
- **mypy configuration**: Type checking settings with reasonable strictness

##### `.flake8` - Flake8 Configuration
- 88 character line length (compatible with black)
- Ignores black-conflicting rules (E203, W503, E501)
- Excludes build directories and virtual environments

#### 3. Development Scripts Created in `scripts/` Directory

##### `scripts/format.sh`
- Runs black for code formatting
- Runs isort for import sorting
- Executable script for quick formatting

##### `scripts/lint.sh`
- Runs flake8 for linting
- Runs mypy for type checking
- Provides comprehensive code quality checks

##### `scripts/quality.sh`
- Master script that runs all quality checks
- Includes formatting, linting, and testing
- One-command solution for complete code quality verification

#### 4. Code Formatting Applied
- Applied black formatting to all 14 Python files in the codebase
- Organized imports with isort across all Python modules
- Ensured consistent code style throughout the project

#### 5. Documentation Updated
- Added "Code Quality Commands" section to `CLAUDE.md`
- Documented all new scripts and individual tool commands
- Provided clear instructions for running quality checks

### Usage

#### Quick Commands
```bash
# Format all code
./scripts/format.sh

# Run all linting checks
./scripts/lint.sh

# Run complete quality check suite
./scripts/quality.sh
```

#### Individual Tools
```bash
uv run black .           # Format with black
uv run isort .           # Sort imports
uv run flake8           # Lint with flake8
uv run mypy .           # Type check with mypy
```

### Benefits
1. **Consistent Formatting** - Automatic code formatting ensures uniform style
2. **Error Prevention** - Linting catches potential issues before runtime
3. **Type Safety** - MyPy provides static type checking for Python
4. **Developer Productivity** - Scripts automate quality checks
5. **Code Quality** - Maintains high standards across the entire codebase

## Testing Infrastructure Implementation

### Overview
Enhanced the testing framework for the RAG system backend with comprehensive API endpoint tests and shared test fixtures.

### Changes Made
- Enhanced testing framework for RAG system backend
- Added API endpoint tests for FastAPI application
- Created shared test fixtures and configuration
- Added pytest configuration to pyproject.toml
- Added httpx>=0.25.0 dependency for HTTP testing

### Files Modified/Created
**Backend Testing Files:**
- `backend/tests/conftest.py` - Created shared fixtures and test configuration
- `backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py` - Created comprehensive API endpoint tests
- `pyproject.toml` - Added pytest configuration and httpx dependency

**Frontend Files:**
None - No frontend changes were made in this implementation.

### Frontend Impact
No frontend files were modified during this implementation. All changes were backend-focused testing infrastructure improvements.

## Frontend UI Features Implementation

### Overview
Added a complete dark/light theme toggle system with smooth transitions and accessibility features.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `frontend/index.html`
- **Added**: Theme toggle button with sun/moon SVG icons
- **Location**: Positioned in the main-content div (top-right via CSS)
- **Features**: 
  - Accessible with proper ARIA labels
  - SVG icons for sun (light theme) and moon (dark theme)
  - Keyboard navigable

#### 2. `frontend/style.css`
- **Added**: Complete light theme CSS variables
  - Light theme uses white backgrounds with dark text
  - Proper contrast ratios for accessibility
  - Consistent color scheme across all components
- **Added**: Theme toggle button styles
  - Fixed position in top-right corner
  - Circular button with smooth hover/focus effects
  - Icon transition animations with rotation and scaling
  - Responsive sizing for mobile devices
- **Added**: Smooth transitions for theme switching
  - 0.3s ease transitions on background, border, and text colors
  - Applied to all interactive elements
- **Enhanced**: Base body styles with transition support

#### 3. `frontend/script.js`
- **Added**: Theme management system
  - `initializeTheme()`: Loads saved theme preference or defaults to dark
  - `toggleTheme()`: Switches between dark and light themes
  - `setTheme()`: Applies theme and saves preference
- **Added**: Event listeners for theme toggle
  - Click handler for mouse interaction
  - Keyboard handler for Enter/Space key accessibility
- **Added**: Local storage integration
  - Saves user's theme preference
  - Persists across browser sessions
- **Enhanced**: DOM element references to include theme toggle button

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Theme Toggle Button Design ✅
- Circular button positioned in top-right corner
- Sun/moon icons that rotate and fade during transitions
- Hover effects with scale animation
- Proper focus states for accessibility

#### 2. Light Theme CSS Variables ✅
- Complete light theme color palette
- High contrast ratios for text readability
- Consistent design language maintained
- All UI components properly themed

#### 3. JavaScript Functionality ✅
- Smooth theme switching with localStorage persistence
- Automatic theme initialization on page load
- Dynamic ARIA label updates for screen readers

#### 4. Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation ✅
- Full keyboard support (Enter/Space keys)
- Proper ARIA labels that update with theme state
- Focus indicators with custom focus rings
- Screen reader friendly

#### 5. Smooth Transitions ✅
- 0.3s ease transitions for all color changes
- Icon rotation and scaling animations
- Consistent animation timing across all elements

### Technical Implementation Details

#### CSS Custom Properties Strategy
- Used CSS custom properties (variables) for all theme colors
- Light theme overrides applied via `[data-theme="light"]` selector
- Maintains design consistency across both themes

#### JavaScript Theme Management
- Theme state stored in `localStorage` as 'theme' key
- DOM updates via `data-theme` attribute on document element
- Icon visibility controlled through CSS opacity and transform

#### Responsive Design
- Button scales appropriately on mobile devices (40px vs 44px)
- Maintains usability across all screen sizes
- Fixed positioning ensures always accessible

### Browser Compatibility
- CSS custom properties (modern browsers)
- localStorage API (all modern browsers)
- SVG icons (universally supported)
- CSS transitions and transforms (modern browsers)

### User Experience
- Theme preference persists across sessions
- Instant visual feedback on interaction
- Smooth, non-jarring transitions
- Accessible to users with disabilities

## Integration
These tools are now integrated into the development workflow and should be run before committing code changes to ensure consistency and quality.
